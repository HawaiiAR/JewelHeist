This was a 1 week rapid prototype built for XRBootcamp.

Passthrough Experiment - dodge the lasers, steal the jewel, dont get caught.

The goal was to work with Oculus Quest's presence platform.  The sprint used passthrough and scene understanding to load a players room and place a podium with a jewel in the center. Lasers were then attatched to the walls and raycast against the players position creating a maze they needed to navigate. Hand tracking was used so that the player could remove the glass protecting the jewel then use two hands to pick up the jewel and return it to the safety of their starting point. 

Concept models were created in blender and textured in substance painter.
